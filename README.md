PURPOSE: 
the main purpose of it to test the map generation from txts and also to make a buffer so that it loads only that part of map that is visible from *SFML View*.
PROBLEMS:
the only remark you can have is that the images in *Cell_Textures* folder may not load and may display a blank white screen because i have given relative paths to them.
if they do not load kindly use *Absloute Path*.
it does not draw *Sprites* instead it just applies Texture to each cell in the grid.
